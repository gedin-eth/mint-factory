<Image src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/CD36UCEP6JG3LF5P5IFCHXEXJI.jpg?auth=ce6428e25fd5b5ad5265a965812559387590d2a334ca02034cceb2272d36a8e3&height=553&width=830&focal=2070,286&quality=80" alt="A bird." width="900" height="500" />
As the NFL season kicks off, the DraftKings Week 1 slate presents a prime opportunity to build lineups that leverage both popular picks and contrarian plays. With a full slate running from Thursday night through Monday, we have plenty of options to consider. Let’s dive into the key players, game scripts, and strategy to help you gain an edge over the competition.

## <b>Quarterbacks to Target </b>
<p> <b>Josh Allen ($8,000, vs. ARI)</b> Josh Allen leads the quarterback slate as a high-ceiling, high-floor option. Facing an Arizona defense ranked 28th against opposing quarterbacks, Allen projects to score 24.78 points, according to the projections sheet. Given his dual-threat ability and Buffalo's high implied team total of 27.3 points, Allen has the potential to post massive fantasy numbers. He’s an ideal anchor in both cash games and tournaments.</p>

<p> <b>Jordan Love ($6,400, vs. CHI)</b> Jordan Love is an intriguing contrarian play at quarterback. Priced at just $6,400, Love faces a Bears defense that is vulnerable through the air, presenting a prime matchup for the young signal-caller. With a projected total of 20.2 points, Love offers a solid floor with the potential for upside if Green Bay's offense finds a rhythm. Pairing Love with a Packers receiver like Romeo Doubs ($4,800) or tight end Luke Musgrave ($2,900) could provide differentiation in tournaments. </p>


## <b> Running Backs to Anchor Your Lineups </b>

<p> <b>Christian McCaffrey ($8,600, vs. NYJ)</b> Christian McCaffrey is the highest-salaried running back on the slate, and for a good reason. Averaging 24.04 fantasy points per game, McCaffrey’s combination of rushing and receiving ability makes him a threat in any game script. The Jets’ defense is solid, but McCaffrey's volume—both on the ground and through the air—makes him a must-consider option, especially in cash games. His high floor and ceiling give you the flexibility to build around him in tournaments.</p>
<p> <b>Isiah Pacheco ($5,800, vs. DET)</b> Isiah Pacheco offers tremendous value at $5,800 against a Detroit defense that struggled against the run last season. Pacheco’s role as the lead back in Kansas City’s offense positions him for significant volume, especially in a matchup where the Chiefs are favored by 6.5 points. If the Chiefs build a lead, expect them to lean on Pacheco to control the game clock. His lower salary allows for greater flexibility when constructing lineups.</p>
<p> <b>Brian Robinson Jr. ($4,900, vs. PHI)</b> Brian Robinson Jr. is a contrarian running back play that could surprise in Week 1. Priced at just $4,900, Robinson faces a Philadelphia defense that ranked 19th against running backs last year. With Antonio Gibson’s role still uncertain, Robinson could see increased touches, particularly in short-yardage and goal-line situations. This makes him a high-upside play at a discounted price.</p>


##  <b>Wide Receivers to Watch</b>

<p> <b>Tyreek Hill ($8,700, vs. JAX)</b> Tyreek Hill headlines the wide receiver group for Week 1, and for good reason. Facing a Jacksonville defense that allowed the 9th most fantasy points to wide receivers last season, Hill's big-play potential makes him a top choice, especially in tournaments. With a projected point total of 24.78, Hill’s speed and ability to turn short passes into long gains can break the slate wide open.</p>
<p> <b>Cooper Kupp ($7,800, vs. SEA)</b> Despite some uncertainty surrounding the Rams' offense, Cooper Kupp remains a target hog when healthy. His $7,800 price tag feels like a bargain given his past production and the expected shootout against Seattle. With Kupp's reliable volume and red zone usage, he’s a fantastic play in both cash and GPP formats.</p>
<p> <b>Wan'Dale Robinson ($3,200, vs. DAL)</b> For those looking for a value play at wide receiver, Wan'Dale Robinson could be your man. Priced at just $3,200, Robinson is projected to see increased targets in a Giants offense facing a tough Dallas defense. However, his low salary and potential for garbage-time production make him a sneaky addition to your lineup that could pay off in GPPs.</p>


## <b>Tight Ends: High Upside and Value Pickss</b>

<p> <b>Mark Andrews ($6,400, vs. HOU)</b>  Mark Andrews is the top option at tight end for Week 1, facing a Houston defense that has struggled against the position. With a projected point total of 19.5, Andrews offers a solid floor and significant upside, especially if Lamar Jackson looks his way often in the red zone. Andrews is a great fit in cash games and a key piece in tournament stacks.</p>
<p> <b>Kyle Pitts ($4,400, vs. CAR)</b>  Kyle Pitts presents an excellent value option at $4,400. Despite a down year in 2023, Pitts remains a dynamic weapon with the potential for explosive plays. Facing a Carolina defense ranked 23rd against tight ends, Pitts could bounce back in a big way. He is a prime candidate for tournament lineups where you need upside at a lower cost. </p>


##  <b>Flex Plays and Defenses</b>
<p> <b>Tyler Conklin ($2,900, vs. BUF)</b> Tyler Conklin is a punt option with potential upside. At just $2,900, he faces a Buffalo defense that can be vulnerable to tight ends in the middle of the field. With a low salary, Conklin allows you to pay up at other positions, making him a valuable flex play in GPP lineups.</p>
<p> <b>Denver Broncos Defense ($3,000, vs. LV)</b> The Denver Broncos defense is a solid mid-range option against a Raiders team with questions at quarterback. Priced at $3,000, they offer a balance of salary relief and upside, particularly if Denver's pass rush can exploit Las Vegas’s offensive line. This defense is worth considering for those looking to save salary without sacrificing upside.</p>


## <b> Game Script Considerations and Strategy</b>

For Week 1, consider game scripts carefully. For instance, if you believe the Chiefs will dominate the Lions, stacking players like Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Isiah Pacheco could yield high returns. Conversely, if you anticipate a closer game, incorporating players from both sides (e.g., Mahomes with Amon-Ra St. Brown) may offer a safer floor.
In cash games, focus on high-floor players like McCaffrey, Hill, and Andrews, whose volume and involvement in their respective offenses are guaranteed. For GPPs, differentiate your lineups by mixing in contrarian plays like Brian Robinson Jr., Jordan Love, or Tyler Conklin.




## <b>Final Thoughts </b>
DraftKings Week 1 slate offers a wide range of possibilities, from the steady producers like Josh Allen and Christian McCaffrey to high-upside, low-owned players such as Jordan Love and Brian Robinson Jr. As you build your lineups, consider both the game scripts and the potential for differentiation in tournaments.
Whether you prefer to stack a particular game or spread your exposure across multiple contests, Week 1 presents a golden opportunity to start the season on a high note. Keep an eye on injury reports, late-breaking news, and weather conditions, as these factors could significantly impact player performance and ownership.
By leveraging data and insights, you can craft a winning strategy that maximizes both your floor and ceiling. Let the games begin!
